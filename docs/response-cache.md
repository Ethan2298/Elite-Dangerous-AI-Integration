# Response Cache System

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Phase 1 Latency Optimization)

The Response Cache system pre-generates and caches TTS audio for frequently used phrases, reducing latency from ~1200ms to <100ms for cached responses.

## Overview

### The Problem

Without caching:
```
User: "Deploy hardpoints"
  ↓ LLM generates: "Hardpoints deployed" (600ms)
  ↓ TTS generates audio (300ms)
  ↓ First audio plays
Total: ~900ms
```

Every time you say "Deploy hardpoints", the exact same audio is regenerated.

### The Solution

With caching:
```
User: "Deploy hardpoints" (First time)
  ↓ LLM: "Hardpoints deployed" (600ms)
  ↓ TTS generates + CACHES audio (300ms)
  ↓ First audio plays
Total: ~900ms

User: "Deploy hardpoints" (Subsequent times)
  ↓ LLM: "Hardpoints deployed" (600ms)
  ↓ CACHE HIT - audio ready instantly!
  ↓ First audio plays
Total: ~650ms (250ms saved)

If using action cache (predicts action):
  ↓ Action cache hit - skip LLM entirely!
  ↓ CACHE HIT - audio ready instantly!
Total: ~50ms (850ms saved!!!)
```

## How It Works

### Auto-Caching Strategy

The cache automatically learns which responses to cache:

1. **Frequency Tracking:** Tracks how many times each phrase is spoken
2. **Smart Caching:** Caches phrases used 3+ times
3. **Common Phrases:** Pre-marks known action confirmations for immediate caching
4. **Size Management:** Auto-evicts least-used items when cache reaches 100MB

### Cache Warming

On startup, the system pre-marks common action responses:

```python
common_phrases = [
    "Hardpoints deployed",
    "Setting speed to zero",
    "Shields up",
    "Landing gear down",
    # ... 15+ more
]
```

These are cached on first use, ensuring they're ready for the second time.

### Cache Storage

- **Location:** `cache/responses/`
- **Format:** Pre-generated PCM audio chunks (24kHz, 16-bit)
- **Metadata:** `cache/responses/metadata.json`
- **Max Size:** 100MB (configurable)

### Cache Key

Each cached item is uniquely identified by:
- Text content
- TTS voice
- Speech speed
- TTS provider

This ensures "Hardpoints deployed" spoken by "nova" at speed 1.0 doesn't conflict with the same text in a different voice.

## Performance Impact

### Expected Cache Hit Rates

Based on typical Elite Dangerous gameplay:

| Scenario | Hit Rate | Savings |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Combat (frequent actions) | 60-70% | ~600ms per hit |
| Trading (repetitive tasks) | 50-60% | ~600ms per hit |
| Exploration (fewer actions) | 30-40% | ~600ms per hit |
| Mixed gameplay | 40-50% | ~600ms per hit |

### Real-World Example

**2-hour combat session:**
- 100 AI responses
- 50 cache hits (50% rate)
- Savings: 50 × 950ms = 47.5 seconds
- Cache size: ~15MB

**Combined with action cache:**
- 30 action predictions hit
- Those skip LLM entirely
- Additional savings: 30 × 600ms = 18 seconds
- **Total time saved: 65.5 seconds in 2 hours**

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Cache

```json
{
  "enable_response_cache": true  // Default: true
}
```

### Cache Settings

Located in `src/lib/ResponseCache.py`:

```python
ResponseCache(
    cache_dir="cache/responses",  // Where to store cache
    max_size_mb=100                // Maximum cache size
)
```

### Clear Cache

Delete the cache directory:
```bash
rm -rf cache/responses
```

Or programmatically:
```python
tts.cache.clear_cache()
```

## Monitoring

### Cache Stats

Logged automatically every ~10 minutes:

```
Response cache stats: 45.2% hit rate, saved 23.4s, 18 items
```

### Get Stats Programmatically

```python
stats = tts.get_cache_stats()
# Returns:
{
    'hits': 45,
    'misses': 55,
    'hit_rate_percent': 45.2,
    'total_saved_ms': 42750,
    'total_saved_seconds': 42.8,
    'cache_size_mb': 8.3,
    'cached_items': 18
}
```

### Debug Logs

Cache activity is logged at debug level:

```
Cache HIT: "Hardpoints deployed" (saved ~950ms)
Cached audio: "Setting speed to zero" (45823 bytes)
Evicted cache: "Some rarely used phrase..."
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Cache Enabled

The cache has minimal overhead and provides significant benefits. Only disable if:
- You're debugging TTS issues
- Disk space is critically low
- You're testing different voices/speeds frequently

### 2. Don't Modify Cached Files

The cache manages itself automatically. Manual modifications may cause issues.

### 3. Monitor Hit Rate

If hit rate is <30%, you might be:
- Playing very variably (exploring unique content)
- Using too many custom voice instructions
- Switching voices/speeds frequently

This is fine - the cache adapts to your playstyle.

### 4. Cache Persists Between Sessions

The cache is saved to disk, so:
- Second session starts with cached phrases ready
- Cache improves over time
- No re-learning required

## Technical Details

### Caching Flow

```python
def _stream_audio(self, text):
    # 1. Check cache
    if self.cache:
        cached_audio = self.cache.get_cached_audio(text, voice, speed, provider)
        if cached_audio:
            # Stream cached audio immediately
            for chunk in chunks(cached_audio):
                yield chunk
            return  # Done!

    # 2. Generate audio (cache miss)
    generated_audio = bytearray()
    for chunk in tts_api.stream():
        generated_audio.extend(chunk)
        yield chunk  # Stream to user

    # 3. Cache for next time
    if self.cache:
        self.cache.cache_audio(text, voice, speed, provider, generated_audio)
```

### Eviction Strategy

When cache reaches 100MB:
1. Sort items by last_used timestamp (oldest first)
2. Remove oldest 20% of cache
3. Free up space for new items

This LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy ensures:
- Frequently used phrases stay cached
- Rarely used phrases are evicted
- Cache size stays bounded

### Thread Safety

The cache is accessed from the TTS playback thread. Thread safety is ensured by:
- Cache operations are atomic (read/write complete files)
- Metadata saves are single-threaded
- No concurrent modifications to same cache entry

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Stats show 0% hit rate
- No files in `cache/responses/`

**Solutions:**
1. Check `enable_response_cache` config
2. Verify write permissions to cache directory
3. Check logs for cache initialization errors

### Cache Files Growing Too Large

**Symptoms:**
- `cache/responses/` >100MB
- Eviction warnings in logs

**Solutions:**
1. This is normal - cache auto-manages size
2. Reduce `max_size_mb` if needed
3. Manually clear cache if excessive

### Incorrect Audio Played

**Symptoms:**
- Wrong phrase spoken
- Voice sounds wrong

**Solutions:**
1. Clear cache (may have corrupted entry)
2. Check if voice/speed changed recently
3. Verify cache key generation is correct

### Disk Space Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Out of disk space warnings
- Cache writes failing

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `max_size_mb` in ResponseCache
2. Clear cache directory
3. Disable cache temporarily

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for Phase 2:

1. **Smart Pre-Warming:**
   - Analyze journal history to predict likely phrases
   - Pre-generate audio on startup for your playstyle

2. **Compressed Storage:**
   - Store audio as MP3 instead of PCM
   - Reduce cache size by ~70%

3. **Shared Cache:**
   - Community-contributed common phrase cache
   - Download pre-generated audio for instant hit rate

4. **Adaptive Caching:**
   - Track time-of-day patterns
   - Cache combat phrases when in combat zones
   - Cache trading phrases when docked at trade stations

5. **Partial Matching:**
   - "Hardpoints deployed" vs "Hardpoints deployed, Commander"
   - Fuzzy matching for similar phrases
